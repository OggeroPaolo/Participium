TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done :
   
  Stories committed: 5 vs. Stories done: 5

- Total points committed vs done :
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) :

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing: 220
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed: 77

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |         |    -   |            |              |
| n      |         |        |            |              |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 3h
  - Total hours spent: 3h 30m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases:220
  - Coverage: 99.68%
- Integration testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 2h 40m
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 7h
  - Total hours spent: 7h
- Code review: 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
- Technical Debt management:
  - Strategy adopted: Take the last day of work to focus or resolving code smells (as stated in SONAR_TD.md)
  - Total hours estimated estimated at sprint planning -> 2h
  - Total hours spent -> 3h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
